## BashFun

Just having some fun with the bash. So far it's lots of fun using bc which is really fast, by the way.

Running on pure shell with some limitations as well as on bash. Not running with zsh, though.

Started with some tiny testing tool, then accidentally discovered BATS, which regrettably is not maintained anymore.
